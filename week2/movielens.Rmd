Read data from the `ratings.csv` file

Loaded `r format(object.size(ratings), units="Mb")` of ratings data, containing `r format(nrow(ratings), big.mark = ",")` ratings. Here's a preview:

# Summary statistics

```{r dist-ratings}

## Per-movie stats

```{r aggregate-by-movie}

# hint: use the n() function for easy counting within a group

  summarize(avg_rating = mean(rating), num_ratings = n())

```

```{r dist-movie-popularity}
# plot distribution of movie popularity (= number of ratings the movie received)

```{r dist-mean-ratings-by-movie}

# Anatomy of the long tail

```{r long-tail}
# generate the equivalent of figure 2 of this paper:
# https://5harad.com/papers/long_tail.pdf

# Specifically, for the subset of users who rated at least 10 movies,
# produce a plot that shows the fraction of users satisfied (vertical
# axis) as a function of inventory size (horizontal axis). We will
# define "satisfied" as follows: an individual user is satisfied p% of
# the time at inventory of size k if at least p% of the movies they
# rated are contained in the top k most popular movies. As in the
# paper, produce one curve for the 100% user satisfaction level and
# another for 90%---do not, however, bother implementing the null
# model (shown in the dashed lines).

#select only users who rated at least 10 movies
user_subset <- ratings %>%
  group_by(user_id) %>%
  filter(n() > 10) %>%
  ungroup()

#count the number of unique users in this subset
num_users <- user_subset %>% select(user_id) %>% unique() %>% count()

#rank the movies by popularity
ranked_movies <- user_subset %>%
  group_by(movie_id) %>%
  summarize(num_ratings = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_ratings)) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(desc(num_ratings))) %>%
  select(movie_id, rank)

#join the user and movie dataframes
df <- inner_join(user_subset, ranked_movies)

ninety <- df %>%
  group_by(user_id) %>%
  mutate(pr = percent_rank(rank)) %>%
  filter(pr <= .9) %>%
  summarize(rank_90 = max(rank)) %>%
  ungroup()

hundred <- df %>%
  group_by(user_id) %>%
  summarize(rank_100 = max(rank)) %>%
  ungroup()

#for each user, the inventory size needed for them to be
#90 and 100 percent satisfied
ranks <- inner_join(ninety, hundred)

#calculate how many users are 90% satisfied with each inventory size
happy90 <- ranks %>%
  select(user_id, rank_90) %>%
  arrange(rank_90) %>%
  mutate(num_90sat = rank(rank_90, ties.method = "first")) %>%
  group_by(rank_90) %>%

#calculate how many users are 100% satisfied with each inventory size
